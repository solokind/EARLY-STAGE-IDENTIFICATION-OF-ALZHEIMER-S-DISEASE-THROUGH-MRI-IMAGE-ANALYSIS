# EARLY-STAGE-IDENTIFICATION-OF-ALZHEIMER-S-DISEASE-THROUGH-MRI-IMAGE-ANALYSIS
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for early-stage Alzheimerâ€™s detection from MRI images. The process involves dataset preparation, image augmentation, model training, and testing. The trained model classifies MRI scans into four categories: Non Demented, Very Mild, Mild, and Moderate Demented.
